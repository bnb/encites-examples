        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [x] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint\r\n- [x]  Address concerns raised by @bnb:\r\n  - [x] There's no clear definition of conflict of interest. Agreement that we need a conflict of interest policy, but can we land this PR without it? ([Link to comment](#discussion_r1446417120))\r\n  - [x] What constitutes report mishandling needs to be defined more clearly. ([Link to comment](#discussion_r1446407933))\r\n  - [x] The escalation and appeal policy described in this PR allow the CoC Team to reverse decisions made at the project level in certain fairly scoped situations. There isn't consensus about this. ([Link to comment](#discussion_r1446422772))\r\n  - [x] The current policy delegates defining case handling processes to the CoC Team. There isn't consensus about this. ([Link to comment](#discussion_r1446431534))\r\n  - [x] There isn't consensus that having a CoC Chair is useful. ([Link to comment](#discussion_r1446436310))\r\n  - [x] There isn't consensus about eligibility criteria. ([Link to comment](#discussion_r1446439889))",

I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\n\nI ride the subway a lot in NYC and buesky is good for that since it's relatively low data for a large amount of content.\n\nAn issue I frequently experience is that when a post with an image is loaded in the feed but my network has disconnected between stops, I can see the preview in the feed but when I tap the image to expand it, another network request is made to grab the full image - presumably a higher quality version. This makes it hard to engage with the contents of this post since I can't actually expand the image for context.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\n\nIdeally, one of a few solutions would work.\n\n- Load full images with one network request, and just use that image for preview/expand.\n- Use the lower quality thumbnail version for the initial expanded view while the network request loads the bigger version.\n- Use thumbnails initially and prefetch bigger images once the content has fully loaded.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\n\n- None? \n\n**Additional context**\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\nThis is really only notable when you're going from connected to disconnected, rapidly switching between connected and disconnected (like in the subway), and when on low data.",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.\n+\n+## Reporting incidents\n+\n+Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.\n+\n+All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:\n+\n+1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.\n+2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.\n+\n+Reporters may choose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipients individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable means.\n+\n+An acknowledgment of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.\n+\n+The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).\n+\n+## Incidents requiring immediate action\n+\n+Individuals responsible for managing incident reports are empowered to take immediate action in order to prevent further harm, for example by blocking someone from accessing virtual spaces managed by a project or the Foundation or by removing someone from an event.\n+\n+These actions must be documented at the earliest convenient occasion for review by the Code of Conduct Team or the other people responsible for managing incident reports for the related project.\n+\n+## Incident Response\n+\n+All incident reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.\n+\n+## Responsiveness\n+\n+Every incident report, escalation request, or appeal will be promptly acknowledged upon receipt and a response provided in a timely manner. All parties involved should be kept informed and updated in a timely and efficient manner.\n+\n+## Transparency\n+\n+The number and relevant details of the reported incidents, escalation requests, and appeals, along with the responses made and actions taken should be made available, at least on a yearly basis, in a redacted form, to the Cross Project Council for further dissemination.\n+\n+## Record keeping\n+\n+A record of all communications related to an incident report, escalation request, or appeal must be kept.\n+\n+## Confidentiality\n+\n+The identity of the harmed individual(s) and the and reporter(s) of an incident report must be kept confidential.\n+\n+## Conflict of Interest\n+\n+Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediately notify the CoC Team in writing and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).\n+\n+## Enforcement\n+\n+### Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team)\n+\n+The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the code of conduct to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) through the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The structure of the CoC Team and how its members are elected are described in the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The current composition of the CoC Team is available in the [code of conduct][CoC] itself along with means to contact by email the whole CoC Team and each of its members individually.\n+\n+The CoC Team is responsible for maintaining and applying the [incident management processes][].\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to involve external people to resolve an issue provided these commit to abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+### Delegation to projects\n+\n+Projects may opt-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves provided they meet the following requirements:\n+\n+1. Commit to uphold the code of conduct.\n+2. Commit to uphold this policy.\n+3. Provide a general email address that incidents can be reported to and document it alongside the code of conduct.\n+4. Define and publicly document a process by which the project selects people responsible for managing incident reports. For Impact and At Large projects, at least two people must be selected.\n+5. List the people responsible for managing incident reports alongside the code of conduct as outlined in the [Reporting incidents section](#reporting-incidents).\n+6. Publicly document their decision-making process for responding to incident reports.\n+7. Document the foundation's escalation and appeal process alongside the code of conduct.\n+8. Participate in good faith in the [escalation](#escalation) and [appeal](#appeals) processes.\n+\n+## Moderation\n+\n+Each project is free to implement moderation processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project provided these processes abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+## Escalation\n+\n+Reporters, harmed individuals, and accused individuals may [escalate](#escalation) an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process in case of a conflict of interest, if the report is not being handled appropriately, or in case of an emergency.\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to manage escalation requests of incident reports managed by projects that have opted-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves.\n+\n+If the CoC Team finds that the escalation request has merit, the CoC Team may decide to takeover the management of the incident report or request changes to the existing management process.

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.\n+\n+## Reporting incidents\n+\n+Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.\n+\n+All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:\n+\n+1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.\n+2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.\n+\n+Reporters may choose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipients individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable means.\n+\n+An acknowledgment of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.\n+\n+The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).\n+\n+## Incidents requiring immediate action\n+\n+Individuals responsible for managing incident reports are empowered to take immediate action in order to prevent further harm, for example by blocking someone from accessing virtual spaces managed by a project or the Foundation or by removing someone from an event.\n+\n+These actions must be documented at the earliest convenient occasion for review by the Code of Conduct Team or the other people responsible for managing incident reports for the related project.\n+\n+## Incident Response\n+\n+All incident reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.\n+\n+## Responsiveness\n+\n+Every incident report, escalation request, or appeal will be promptly acknowledged upon receipt and a response provided in a timely manner. All parties involved should be kept informed and updated in a timely and efficient manner.\n+\n+## Transparency\n+\n+The number and relevant details of the reported incidents, escalation requests, and appeals, along with the responses made and actions taken should be made available, at least on a yearly basis, in a redacted form, to the Cross Project Council for further dissemination.\n+\n+## Record keeping\n+\n+A record of all communications related to an incident report, escalation request, or appeal must be kept.\n+\n+## Confidentiality\n+\n+The identity of the harmed individual(s) and the and reporter(s) of an incident report must be kept confidential.\n+\n+## Conflict of Interest\n+\n+Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediately notify the CoC Team in writing and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "(sorry for double comment, hit send on the first one mindlessly)\r\n\r\n> Top-level fields in package.json should be respected by all tools that work with packages.\r\n\r\n@GeoffreyBooth again, just want to disagree here. Top level pacakge.json is intentionally vague - any tool can \"add\" fields to it. There are many, many, many examples of this, even between package managers - see overrides vs. resolutions, engines, literally any linting tooling or compiler tools. Functionally, this is not how the ecosystem works.\r\n\r\n> The “pnpm users are running the wrong version of pnpm” problem feels like something that perhaps pnpm could solve on its own.\r\n\r\n@GeoffreyBooth I fully agree with this and think this is explictly a non-issue for Node.js.\r\n\r\n>That is a great goal, but it doesn't mean that every package manager wants to utilize that solution, and I would like to state that they shouldn't have to.\r\n\r\n@MylesBorins huge +1 to this. IMO the Node.js project should not be making decisions that _force_ a package manager to implement something. We should be giving them _options_ that they can take advantage of that will benefit _our_ users DX. This does not seem like \"fairness\" to me, if \"fairness\" is a stated goal (which is clearly and reasonably challenged in this issue).\r\n\r\n> Forcing all future package managers to support specific features, and making corepack the only blessed path into Node.js core, is not fair.\r\n\r\nAgain, full +1.\r\n\r\n> It feels like a bug to me if Node’s documentation defines a packageManager field and then the package manager that Node includes, npm, doesn’t support it. And npm supporting packageManager when installed via Corepack, an installation method that npm doesn’t support, doesn’t count. It still feels inconsistent and broken.\r\n\r\n@GeoffreyBooth Honestly, I agree with this and it captures something that seems to be a struggle in this thread: some folks' perception is that corepack is being built independently and operates outside of the Node.js decision making structure. If that's true, what fields it supports should not be the concern of Node.js. If Corepack _is_ a part of Node.js to the point its docs are shipping inside of the Node.js documentation, IMO that is surface area that Node.js fully owns and Corepack being an independent tool is not a valid way to justify decisions around critique of its DX. Again, this would be much easier to discuss if we strictly outlined the relationship between Node.js and package managers and how Corepack is a part of that.",

Perhaps it's a substitution of s/corepack/corepack enabled by default in Node.js/ or something like that, but having that well documented criteria should be a gatekeeper for this. We shouldn't be choosing whether or not pnpm vs. yarn vs. cnpm gets in by default based off vibes - we should be doing it based off an agreed upon standard so the decisions are consistent.\r\n\r\n> The lack of a clearly articulated list of problems addressed by this program, along with a justification for those problems being node's problems, and an exploration of the alternatives and their relative costs/benefits, is imo a failure of the Node project. That should have happened years ago, but it was pushed through without adequately exploring the subject. Many words were written on the subject, but I have seen no identification of problems solved and comparisons to alternative solutions, which should have been a requirement to shipping a new binary in a project as mature as Node.\r\n\r\n@isaacs fully agree with this. \r\n\r\n> Node.js and npm each have a claim to the package.json file. Node has created several fields used in there, like type and exports and imports, and obviously npm has created many others. The Corepack effort has created a new field, [packageManager](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packagemanager), to define what package manager and version is intended to be used to develop the associated project.\r\n\r\n@GeoffreyBooth this part of your comment around `packageManager` support eposes why I don't think it's reasonable to expect that `packageManager` is supported outside of corepack. \r\n\r\nOne of your examples is that Node.js defined `type`, `exports`, and `imports`... npm doesn't support those. Node.js doesn't support  package.json entries like `engines`, or `description`, or `dependencies`... hell, even `version` isn't processed by Node.js as far as I'm aware. \r\n\r\nWhy should the existence of another project making a field require support from Node.js or npm or any other tool? IMO it's inconsistent to expect that.\r\n\r\n> If the main problem we want to solve is to get folks using the same package manager on projects then point me to where that specific problem was discussed and adequately addresed. \r\n\r\n@wesleytodd 100% agree. \r\n\r\n> To be clear, the last few vocal people in this thread who fail to see the problems that Corepack solves were all affiliated with pre-acquisition npm - either former employees, or regular meeting attendee. It should come to no surprise that they have their own idea of what an appropriate developer experience is - Yarn was created in part because we didn't agree with those principles.\r\n\r\nIMHO it's genuinely unhelpful to create an us vs. them like this. Maintainers and involved community members from each of the package managers have gotten themselves involved in this thread - I recognize almost everyone in here from various forms of package manager community. This is a space with strong opinions and absurd amounts of historical context.\r\n\r\nYou are a former employee of Facebook - does that mean you're still pushing the corporate agenda of Facebook? I personally don't think so and I don't believe anyone here is thinking about it that way. You're currently an employee of an APM - _theoretically_, could corepack affect performance. Are you doing this to benefit your company? Again, I think the answer is categorically no and again nobody thinks that's the case.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the Node.js project we go to great lengths to put aside corporate affiliation. There are a number of places this is documented, and many ways it's socially codified in how we work. This discussion particularly feels like a strange deviation form that and it really makes me sad.\r\n\r\nGenerally, not specific to the above comment, the commentary around on @MylesBorins's involvement in this thread for example - effectively removing his individuality and putting him in the position of being a corporate puppet - is deeply disappointing and ignores literally a decade+ of time he's put into this project, including things he's responsible for that are being cited in this thread as parts of \"Node.js\".\r\n\r\nI'd really like to request that we move for this discussion to be absent of accusations or implications of corporations or open source projects trying to affect change in specific directions to further their own interests. I don't think it's healthy for Node.js as a project to be operating in that way, and I don't believe we can actually achieve a solution that's truly _what's best for users_ if we're taking that approach.\r\n\r\n> So the question should actually be: what should change in Corepack so enabling it can have consensus? What are the actionable steps?\r\n\r\n@aduh95 I've already stated this: documentation of criteria for acceptance to be enabled by default via corepack in Node.js (like yarn and pnpm would presumably be) should be landed before those things are accepted. IMO, based on the discourse in this thread, this should probably be documented as \"Acceptance Criteria of New Package Mangers\" and then have the implementation detail of embedding vs. corepack not actually matter. We need to be able to reason about the choices we're making consistently.",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.\n+\n+## Reporting incidents\n+\n+Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.\n+\n+All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:\n+\n+1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.\n+2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.\n+\n+Reporters may choose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipients individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable means.\n+\n+An acknowledgment of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.\n+\n+The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).\n+\n+## Incidents requiring immediate action\n+\n+Individuals responsible for managing incident reports are empowered to take immediate action in order to prevent further harm, for example by blocking someone from accessing virtual spaces managed by a project or the Foundation or by removing someone from an event.\n+\n+These actions must be documented at the earliest convenient occasion for review by the Code of Conduct Team or the other people responsible for managing incident reports for the related project.\n+\n+## Incident Response\n+\n+All incident reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.\n+\n+## Responsiveness\n+\n+Every incident report, escalation request, or appeal will be promptly acknowledged upon receipt and a response provided in a timely manner. All parties involved should be kept informed and updated in a timely and efficient manner.\n+\n+## Transparency\n+\n+The number and relevant details of the reported incidents, escalation requests, and appeals, along with the responses made and actions taken should be made available, at least on a yearly basis, in a redacted form, to the Cross Project Council for further dissemination.\n+\n+## Record keeping\n+\n+A record of all communications related to an incident report, escalation request, or appeal must be kept.\n+\n+## Confidentiality\n+\n+The identity of the harmed individual(s) and the and reporter(s) of an incident report must be kept confidential.\n+\n+## Conflict of Interest\n+\n+Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediately notify the CoC Team in writing and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).\n+\n+## Enforcement\n+\n+### Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team)\n+\n+The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the code of conduct to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) through the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The structure of the CoC Team and how its members are elected are described in the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The current composition of the CoC Team is available in the [code of conduct][CoC] itself along with means to contact by email the whole CoC Team and each of its members individually.\n+\n+The CoC Team is responsible for maintaining and applying the [incident management processes][].\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to involve external people to resolve an issue provided these commit to abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+### Delegation to projects\n+\n+Projects may opt-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves provided they meet the following requirements:\n+\n+1. Commit to uphold the code of conduct.\n+2. Commit to uphold this policy.\n+3. Provide a general email address that incidents can be reported to and document it alongside the code of conduct.\n+4. Define and publicly document a process by which the project selects people responsible for managing incident reports. For Impact and At Large projects, at least two people must be selected.\n+5. List the people responsible for managing incident reports alongside the code of conduct as outlined in the [Reporting incidents section](#reporting-incidents).\n+6. Publicly document their decision-making process for responding to incident reports.\n+7. Document the foundation's escalation and appeal process alongside the code of conduct.\n+8. Participate in good faith in the [escalation](#escalation) and [appeal](#appeals) processes.\n+\n+## Moderation\n+\n+Each project is free to implement moderation processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project provided these processes abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+## Escalation\n+\n+Reporters, harmed individuals, and accused individuals may [escalate](#escalation) an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process in case of a conflict of interest, if the report is not being handled appropriately, or in case of an emergency.\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to manage escalation requests of incident reports managed by projects that have opted-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves.\n+\n+If the CoC Team finds that the escalation request has merit, the CoC Team may decide to takeover the management of the incident report or request changes to the existing management process. \n+\n+Projects are expected to participate in good faith in the escalation process and to share all the information related to the incident report with the CoC Team.\n+\n+## Appeals\n+\n+Harmed individuals and accused individuals have thirty (30) days to appeal to the CoC Team a decision made in response to an incident report. Decisions may only be appealled on the grounds that the documented process was not properly followed or that it did not meet the requirements of this policy. If the CoC Team finds that the appeal has merit, it may decide to override the decision that was previously made.\n+\n+If the initial report was already managed by the CoC Team, a different set of CoC Team members should be chosen to manage the appeal process. The CoC Team may choose to involve external people if needed.\n+\n+If the appeal follows an incident report managed by a project, the project is expected to participate in good faith in the appeal process and to share all the information related to the incident report with the CoC Team.\n+\n+Appeals are not suspensive.",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.\n+\n+## Reporting incidents\n+\n+Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.\n+\n+All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:\n+\n+1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.\n+2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.\n+\n+Reporters may choose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipients individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable means.\n+\n+An acknowledgment of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.\n+\n+The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).\n+\n+## Incidents requiring immediate action\n+\n+Individuals responsible for managing incident reports are empowered to take immediate action in order to prevent further harm, for example by blocking someone from accessing virtual spaces managed by a project or the Foundation or by removing someone from an event.\n+\n+These actions must be documented at the earliest convenient occasion for review by the Code of Conduct Team or the other people responsible for managing incident reports for the related project.\n+\n+## Incident Response\n+\n+All incident reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.\n+\n+## Responsiveness\n+\n+Every incident report, escalation request, or appeal will be promptly acknowledged upon receipt and a response provided in a timely manner. All parties involved should be kept informed and updated in a timely and efficient manner.\n+\n+## Transparency\n+\n+The number and relevant details of the reported incidents, escalation requests, and appeals, along with the responses made and actions taken should be made available, at least on a yearly basis, in a redacted form, to the Cross Project Council for further dissemination.\n+\n+## Record keeping\n+\n+A record of all communications related to an incident report, escalation request, or appeal must be kept.\n+\n+## Confidentiality\n+\n+The identity of the harmed individual(s) and the and reporter(s) of an incident report must be kept confidential.\n+\n+## Conflict of Interest\n+\n+Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediately notify the CoC Team in writing and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.\n+\n+## Reporting incidents\n+\n+Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.\n+\n+All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:\n+\n+1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.\n+2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.\n+\n+Reporters may choose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipients individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable means.\n+\n+An acknowledgment of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.\n+\n+The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).\n+\n+## Incidents requiring immediate action\n+\n+Individuals responsible for managing incident reports are empowered to take immediate action in order to prevent further harm, for example by blocking someone from accessing virtual spaces managed by a project or the Foundation or by removing someone from an event.\n+\n+These actions must be documented at the earliest convenient occasion for review by the Code of Conduct Team or the other people responsible for managing incident reports for the related project.\n+\n+## Incident Response\n+\n+All incident reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.\n+\n+## Responsiveness\n+\n+Every incident report, escalation request, or appeal will be promptly acknowledged upon receipt and a response provided in a timely manner. All parties involved should be kept informed and updated in a timely and efficient manner.\n+\n+## Transparency\n+\n+The number and relevant details of the reported incidents, escalation requests, and appeals, along with the responses made and actions taken should be made available, at least on a yearly basis, in a redacted form, to the Cross Project Council for further dissemination.\n+\n+## Record keeping\n+\n+A record of all communications related to an incident report, escalation request, or appeal must be kept.\n+\n+## Confidentiality\n+\n+The identity of the harmed individual(s) and the and reporter(s) of an incident report must be kept confidential.\n+\n+## Conflict of Interest\n+\n+Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediately notify the CoC Team in writing and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).\n+\n+## Enforcement\n+\n+### Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team)\n+\n+The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the code of conduct to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) through the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The structure of the CoC Team and how its members are elected are described in the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The current composition of the CoC Team is available in the [code of conduct][CoC] itself along with means to contact by email the whole CoC Team and each of its members individually.\n+\n+The CoC Team is responsible for maintaining and applying the [incident management processes][].\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to involve external people to resolve an issue provided these commit to abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+### Delegation to projects\n+\n+Projects may opt-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves provided they meet the following requirements:\n+\n+1. Commit to uphold the code of conduct.\n+2. Commit to uphold this policy.\n+3. Provide a general email address that incidents can be reported to and document it alongside the code of conduct.\n+4. Define and publicly document a process by which the project selects people responsible for managing incident reports. For Impact and At Large projects, at least two people must be selected.\n+5. List the people responsible for managing incident reports alongside the code of conduct as outlined in the [Reporting incidents section](#reporting-incidents).\n+6. Publicly document their decision-making process for responding to incident reports.\n+7. Document the foundation's escalation and appeal process alongside the code of conduct.\n+8. Participate in good faith in the [escalation](#escalation) and [appeal](#appeals) processes.\n+\n+## Moderation\n+\n+Each project is free to implement moderation processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project provided these processes abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+## Escalation\n+\n+Reporters, harmed individuals, and accused individuals may [escalate](#escalation) an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process in case of a conflict of interest, if the report is not being handled appropriately, or in case of an emergency.\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to manage escalation requests of incident reports managed by projects that have opted-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves.\n+\n+If the CoC Team finds that the escalation request has merit, the CoC Team may decide to takeover the management of the incident report or request changes to the existing management process.

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and in the CNCF and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n    - [ ] Add or remove email lists accordingly\r\n    - [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.\r\n- [ ] Add the CoC Team Charter (and in particular clarify the makeup and selection process of the CoC Team) (@PaulaPaul).\r\n- [ ] Should the privacy policy also protect the accused person, and if so, what are the necessary exceptions? \r\n- [ ] Reach out to projects who would be affected by these changes:\r\n  - AMP Project\r\n  - Appium\r\n  - Electron\r\n  - Express.js\r\n  - Fastify\r\n  - HospitalRun\r\n  - LoopBack\r\n  - Node.js\r\n  - Node-RED\r\n  - Webdriver.io\r\n  - Webhint",

It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\n+\n+A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.\n+\n+All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activities related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)\n+\n+Projects joining the foundation that already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects that don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.\n+\n+## Reporting incidents\n+\n+Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.\n+\n+All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:\n+\n+1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.\n+2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.\n+\n+Reporters may choose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipients individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable means.\n+\n+An acknowledgment of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.\n+\n+The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).\n+\n+## Incident Response\n+\n+All incident reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.\n+\n+## Transparency\n+\n+The number and relevant details of the incidents reported, escalation requests, and appeals, along with the responses made and actions taken should be made available in a redacted form to the Cross Project Council for further dissemination on a yearly basis.\n+\n+## Record keeping\n+\n+A record of all communications related to an incident report, escalation request, or appeal must be kept.\n+\n+## Confidentiality\n+\n+The identity of the victim(s) and reporter(s) of a code of conduct violation must be kept confidential.\n+\n+## Conflict of Interest\n+\n+Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediately notify the CoC Team in writing and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).\n+\n+## Enforcement\n+\n+### Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team)\n+\n+The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the code of conduct to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) through the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The structure of the CoC Team and how its members are elected are described in the [CoC Team Charter][].\n+\n+The current composition of the CoC Team is available in the [code of conduct][CoC] itself along with means to contact by email the whole CoC Team and each of its members individually.\n+\n+The CoC Team is responsible for maintaining and applying the [incident management processes][].\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to involve external people to resolve an issue provided these abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+### Delegation to projects\n+\n+Projects may opt-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves provided they meet the following requirements:\n+\n+1. Agree to abide by this policy.\n+2. Provide a general email address that incidents can be reported to and document it alongside the code of conduct.\n+3. Define and publicly document a process by which the project selects people responsible for managing incident reports. For Impact and At Large projects, at least two people must be selected.\n+4. List the people responsible for managing incident reports alongside the code of conduct as outlined in the [Reporting incidents section](#reporting-incidents).\n+5. Publicly document their decision-making process for responding to incident reports.\n+6. Document the foundation's escalation and appeal process alongside the code of conduct.\n+7. Participate in good faith in the escalation and appeal processes.\n+\n+Reporters, victims, and offenders may [escalate](#escalation) an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process in case of a conflict of interest. They may [appeal](#appeals) the decision to the CoC Team up to thirty (30) days after a response was provided if they believe that the process was not followed properly.\n+\n+## Moderation\n+\n+Each project is free to implement moderation processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project provided these processes abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.\n+\n+## Escalation\n+\n+The CoC Team is empowered to manage escalation requests of incident reports managed by projects that have opted-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves.\n+\n+Projects are expected to participate in good faith in the escalation process. \n+\n+## Appeals\n+\n+Victim(s) and offender(s) of an incident have thirty (30) days to appeal to the CoC Team the decision made in response to an incident report if they believe the process was not properly followed.\n+\n+If the initial report was already managed by the CoC Team, a different set of CoC Team members should be chosen to manage the appeal process. The CoC Team may choose to involve external people if needed.\n+\n+If the appeal follows an incident report managed by a project, the project is expected to participate in the appeal process in good faith. \n+\n+Appeals are not suspensive.\n+\n+[CoC]: https://code-of-conduct.openjsf.org/\n+[Charter]: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/CPC-CHARTER.md\n+[CoC Team Charter]: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/conduct/COC_TEAM_CHARTER.md",

        "body": "- Clearly split all CoC related-documents into 4 buckets:\r\n    1. The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n- [ ] Add or reove email lists accordingly\r\n- [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n- [ ] Add or reove email lists accordingly\r\n- [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.",

The **Code of Conduct** itself, which is also the source of truth for the makeup of the CoC Team, how to contact the CoC Team, and how to report an incident, escalate it, and appeal a decision.\r\n    2. The **Code of Conduct Policy**, which defines the higher level aspects of our code of conduct implementation (the _what_).\r\n    3. The **CoC Team Charter** which is the mean by which the CPC delegates responsibilities to the CoC Team.\r\n    4. Various related **processes** which describe _how_ the policy is implemented.\r\n- Replace the Code of Conduct Panel with a Code of Conduct Team instead.\r\n- Make the CoC Team responsible for all of the incident report management processes.\r\n- Standardize on the language used in the Contributor Covenant and use it consistently throughout.\r\n- Clarify the escalation and appeal policies.\r\n- Be explicit about the projects's freedom to implement moderation policies\r\n- Create a placeholder for all of the processes related to the makeup and structure of the CoC Team.\r\n- Add an indication at the top of each related file pointing people who just want to report an incident to the right place.\r\n- Clean up a number of smaller issues.\r\n- Clarify the requirements for projects who opt-in to manage incident reports themselves. Make the policy generic so that it applies both to those projects and to the CoC. Partially addresses #786.\r\n\r\n### Still to do:\r\n- [ ] Decide whether it is better to separate report@, coc-escalation@, and  coc-appeal@ or just use report@ for all the things.\r\n- [ ] Add or reove email lists accordingly\r\n- [ ] Update the CoC accordingly.",

If you feel you've been added in error, or are not on the list and should be, please reach out or comment here. 🙏_",

        "body": "This repository would serve much the same purpose as Mozilla's standards positions repository seen here: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions ... that is, it would effectively serve as the repository for the Node.js project's official thoughts for various specifications relevant to Node.js.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nNode.js implements support for multiple internet and web standards (TCP, HTTP, TLS, WHATWG URL, Streams, Encoding, fetch, etc). Historically, the Node.js project has never maintained any official position favorable or unfavorable towards any particular specification. Instead it has relied mostly on the individual opinions and perspectives of individual contributors. Some of these individual contributors have participated in various standards bodies such as TC-39 or WHATWG representing their own personal points of view. That participation, however, often becomes confusing when it is not clear if they are speaking on behalf of the project representing a consensus opinion among the contributors or merely their own individual opinions. This repository would seek to eliminate that confusion by providing an authoritative source for consensus agreements.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nFollowing the model of the Mozilla repository, we will apply one of three labels to new specifications: (I've borrowed the language here from Mozilla's documentation)\r\n\r\n* `positive` - Node.js regards this work as a potential improvement to the Node.js ecosystem.\r\n* `neutral` - Node.js is not convinced of the merits of this work, but does not see any significant negative potential.\r\n* `negative` - Node.js believes that pursuing this work in its current form would not be good for the Node.js ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThese positions will be based on our best assessment of the current state of the specification and the potential for it to benefit our users and the ecosystem as a whole. We consider the intended purpose and the design fundamentals of each specification. Incomplete documentation, minor issues, or lack of interoperability testing are not reasons for a negative position, provided that intent is clear.\r\n\r\nWe might also use the following labels for specifications where we have not formed a position:\r\n\r\n* `defer` - Node.js takes no position on this work.\r\n* `under consideration` - Node.js has not taken a position on this work and is gathering more information.\r\n\r\nAn already published position that, for whatever reason, becomes no longer relevant can be marked `obsolete`.\r\n \r\nA proposal to publish an opinion towards a particular specification would come in the form of a new issue in the `nodejs/standards-position` repository. The issue should identify the spec and the rationale for seeking a position. It should not argue a particular position label one way or the other but simply ask that the spec be considered. If there are no objections raised to the proposal after seven calendar days, then the proposal is considered accepted and work can start to publish a position.\r\n\r\nEach position itself would be published as a separate markdown file in the repository, originating with a pull request whose process for acceptance follows the same process as landing semver-major changes in the core Node.js repository. That is, a position paper cannot land without approval from at least two TSC members and without all relevant feedback having been addressed. Collaborators will be encouraged to follow the respository and actively weigh in where they feel necessary.\r\n\r\nPositions are living documents that can be revisited and altered as necessary when new information is received or project requirements  evolve. We will use the git history to track any changes in position over time.\r\n\r\n## Template for position proposals\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- Please use only the specification title as the issue title. -->\r\n\r\n## Request for Node.js Position on an Emerging Specification\r\n\r\n* Specification title: \r\n* Specification or proposal URL (if available): \r\n* Explainer URL (if available):\r\n* Proposal author(s) (`@`-mention GitHub accounts): \r\n* Node.js collaborators or ecosystem members who can provide input (optional): \r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Which specifications\r\n\r\nAgain, borrowing language from the Mozilla repository:\r\n\r\nSpecifications that are relevant to JavaScript and WebAssembly runtimes like Node.js are in-scope here; specifications that are specific to Web Browsers but not Node.js (e.g. specifications involving Web platform features that are unlikely to ever be implemented directly by Node.js) are not, and will be marked invalid.\r\n\r\nTo be considered, a specification needs to be published under well-understood IPR terms. This currently includes:\r\n\r\n* Ecma TC39 proposals\r\n* IETF RFCs and Internet-Drafts\r\n* W3C drafts, Recommendations and Notes (including Community Group documents, e.g. WICG, WinterCG)\r\n* WHATWG Living Standards (typically we consider change proposals)\r\n\r\nIf a specification has been abandoned, deprecated, or obsoleted by its publishing body, this generally indicates that it is not under consideration.\r\n\r\nIf a specification is already implemented by Node.js (or is in the development process), it typically won't be necessary to determine a position on it, since we're already devoting resources to it.\r\n\r\n## Why now?\r\n\r\nThis was discussed at length at the Collaborator Summit held during the NodeConf.eu event this past week in Kilkenny Ireland. The core of the discussion was around how the project can come to consensus on support for new specifications and standards that may impact Node.js development moving forward. Newer efforts such as WinterCG increase the need for a more formalized process of determining the consensus opinion of the project.",
